Cardboard box-Room, This room has about two thousand cardboard boxes. None of them contain anything, except perhaps more boxes.
Armory-Room, This room contains a sword stand. There are five places for swords, but only two swords. The first is so used it has turned blunt, and the other is broken in half.
Internal-room, this room has walls of dark jagged rock. The ceiling has been painted black. 
Dome-room, the ceiling of this room is an arching dome with hundreds of tiny round openings in it, apparently air vents or perhaps speaking tubes. 
Aquarium-Room, This room is almost completely filled by an aquarium in the middle of it.
Eye-Room, The walls of this room have been decorated with different coloured marble eyes. They all seem to stare at anyone entering.
Dark-room, this room is dark. Really really dark. Any light source, which is brought into this room only illuminates it in a five foot radius.
Bathtub-Room, this room contains a few dusty bathtubs. A couple of them are hooked up to pipes coming from the walls.
Tiles-Room, The floor of this room is covered in marble tiles. The tiles have different coloured numbers on them, but these seem completely random.
Sun-Room, Stepping into this room is like entering a desert during a high sun. The walls are a faded yellow, and the floor has a sandlike pattern. The ceiling is a bright white. Staying in this room for longer than 5 minutes makes you feel parched.
